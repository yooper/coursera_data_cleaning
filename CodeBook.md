Data Sets
======================

The data sets came from two locations. The raw_district_name_by_city_by_county.xml was screen scraped using Firefox and the utility Firebug. The web site used ajax calls to load the data after arriving at the site. See http://www.greatschools.org/schools/districts/Michigan/MI

The other data files were retrieved from the State of Michigan's web site and the file names were shortened for simplicity. See http://www.michigan.gov/cepi/0,1607,7-113-21423_30451_30460---,00.html You will have to navigate to sub pages to pull the data you are looking for.
